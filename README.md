# Word-Graph2vec
Word Graph2vec is a graph based word embedding algorithm that converts a large corpus into a word co-occurrence graph, randomly selects word sequence samples, and embeds words into the sampled corpus for training. We assume that due to the limited vocabulary, large number of idioms, and fixed expressions in English, the size and density of word co-occurrence maps will slightly change with the increase of the training corpus. Therefore, WordGraph2vec has stable runtime on large-scale datasets, and its performance advantage becomes increasingly evident as the training corpus grows. See more details in the paper:[Word-Graph2vec: An Efficient Word Embedding Approach on Word Co-occurrence Graph Using Random Walk Technique](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-7254-8_68)
